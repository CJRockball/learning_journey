# Financial Modeling - (2020-ongoing)

## Phase Overview
I've always been interested in economy and finance, I studied it extensively at university. This is one of my favorite applications of data science. One advantage is that this area has a lot of data. One point of frustration, though, is that data in this subject always seems to change distributions. It also naturally lends itself to several aspects I am interested in working on, such as big data, high speed performance, visualisation and graphing. 

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding of economic and financial relationships
- Phyton capabilities in this area
- Combines many of the aspects of machine learning, maths and statistics and programming

## Key Projects

### Option Valuation and Web App (19-03-2022-24-03-2022)
**Technologies:** numba cuda, cupy, scipy fft, fastapi
**Description:** Use different methods to calculate vanilla options and make a user interface
**Learning Focus:** How practical valuation of options is done, mode experience with gpu calculations
**Status:** Raw Code

### [Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/CJRockball/Portfolio_optimization) (2020)
**Technologies:** Flask, sqlite, Flask
**Description:** Choose stocks, download save data to database, make portfolio calculations and visualizations, display online
**Learning Focus:** Financial calculations, web, database
**Status:** Complete

## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python
- **Data Science:** pandas, numpy, 
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, FastAPI

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** Mostly based on math and statistics
- **Challenges Overcome:** Implement direct calculations as tensors and in cuda
- **Next Phase Setup:** This is more or less a freestanding application of machine learning

## Code Status & Next Steps
