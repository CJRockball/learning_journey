# Deployment - Phase 3 - (2021-2023)

## Phase Overview
Being able to display and share the results is important. In 2018 I started using Flask for web projects. I took a coursera course in Django, but didn't like it. Then in 2021 I started transitioning to FastAPI. FastAPI is not only a web page frontend, it is also the foundation for many modern APIs. As a result of starting to explore FastAPI I also started using and setting up RESTful APIs. It also became natural to explore cloud deployment. 

## Learning Objectives
- Primary focus was to understand and implement frontends with FastAPI, HTML and CSS
- Secondary was different graphing/plotting tools as ways to display information
- This ties in naturally with machine learning as a was it serve and present information

## Key Projects

### Serve Model for Taiwan Credit Card Dataset Predictions (23/12/2021-28/12/2021)
**Technologies:** FastAPI, Docker, XGB, SQLite
**Description:** Serve a model for prediction using FastAPI
**Learning Focus:** Deploy a solution to the cloud with backend/frontend and a database
**Status:** Complete for serving on Heroku


## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python, HTML, CSS
- **Data Science:** FastAPI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Pyplot, SQLite, Requests, HTTPx
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Hekoru

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** My Flask experience made it easy to transition to FastAPI for a webpage frontend. But Fastapi's design also got me started with microservices and RESTful APIs
- **Challenges Overcome:** Learning FastAPI nomenclature was easy enough. Setting up structured APIs was a bigger challenge.
- **Next Phase Setup:** This was important as it is part of a "whole package" for machine learning solutions
