# Performance - Phase 3 - (2022-2024)

## Phase Overview
Performance optimization is important especially with an interpreted language like Python. I explored different ways to increase performance like multi-threading, precompiling and GPU. For large data it's more about chunking when it doesn't fit in RAM.

## Learning Objectives
- Primary objbective was to execute code faster
- Secondary objective was to analyze and process large amounts of data
- Once basic data analysis is working, I wanted to analyze more data

## Key Projects

### [MandelBrot_Viz](https://github.com/CJRockball/Mandelbrot) (05/02/2022-15/02/2022)
**Technologies:** Numba cuda, matplotlib
**Description:** Create the fastest possible calculation of mandelbrot fractals to create graph with real time zoom
**Learning Focus:** Learn how to use CUDA for calculations
**Status:** Complete

### [Another Project] ([Date Range])
[Same format as above]

## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python, C/C++
- **Data Science:** Dask, cprofiler,lineprofiler, memory profiler, numba jit, multithreading, CUDA
- **Infrastructure:** 

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** This was applied to existing projects
- **Challenges Overcome:** Learning about GPUs and CUDA, implementing code in C/C++
- **Next Phase Setup:** This is required for larger data analysis projects
