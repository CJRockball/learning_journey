# Performance - Phase 3 - (2022-2024)

## Phase Overview
Performance optimization is important especially with an interpreted language like Python. I explored different ways to increase performance like multi-threading, precompiling and GPU. For large data it's more about chunking when it doesn't fit in RAM.

## Learning Objectives
- Primary objbective was to execute code faster
- Secondary objective was to analyze and process large amounts of data
- Once basic data analysis is working, I wanted to analyze more data
