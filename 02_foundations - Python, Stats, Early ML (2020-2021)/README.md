# Foundations - Phase 1 - (2020-2021)

## Phase Overview
At university I studied a lot of math and computer science. I now started applying that to machine learning. In 2008 I started more specific data anlaysis studies, which culminated in my Six Sigma Black Belt in 2017. I used MATLAB as my main language up til 2014, when I switched over to Python. At this point I got a Coursera subscription and started studying a wide range of subjects focused on machine learning, AI and computer science. 

## Learning Objectives
- The primary focus was on Statistics, Python and infra for machine learning and AI
- Secondary was different languages that could be beneficial such as Java, SQL, PHP and R
- Having no professional setting these courses where ment to introduce how machine learning is used in industry

## Key Projects

### Stock Database and Viz (11/2020)
**Technologies:** Flask, SQLite, Yahoo Finance
**Description:** The goal was to practice backend/frontend, integrating database, practice some portfolio math
**Learning Focus:** The main take away was starting to use databases for storing data
**Status:** https://github.com/CJRockball/Stock_DB

**Status:** [Complete/Raw Code/Documentation Needed]


## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python, Java, SQL, PHP, R, Tableau
- **Data Science:** Tensorflow2, XGB, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
- **Infrastructure:** SQL, GCP,  Cloudera, Docker

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** Having basic knowledge of programming and maths this period was partially a refresher especially for databases and SQL. I also used larger datasets in some of these courses which was interesting.
- **Challenges Overcome:** A new area for me was cloud computing. Several of the courses used GCP which served as a good introduction. 
- **Next Phase Setup:** After having done mostly small scale experiments with statistical data, these courses introduced me to the larger size data used in machine learning and AI.
