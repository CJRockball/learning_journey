# Patrick Carlberg - Technical Learning Journey (2019–2025)

This repository documents my journey to mastery in data science, analytics, optimization, and cloud-based engineering. During my professional “intermission” between formal roles, I:

- Completed >40 advanced courses and certifications (see [certificates](coursera_certificates/))
- Progressively applied new tech skills to independent projects
- Documented learning sprints and project outcomes (see subfolders)

## Timeline and Growth Themes

- **2020–2021:** Intensive upskilling through online courses (Python, Stats, ML, Cloud)
- **2021–2023:** Solo project building: cleaning, ML, ETL, API design, simulation, and Github workflows
- **2023–2025:** Full code modularization, documentation, and real-world deployment practice

## Highlights by Tech Domain

- **Python:** Foundations, scripting, API/ETL design
- **Data Engineering:** SQL, Pandas, cloud deployment
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, advanced supervised/unsupervised pipelines
- **Simulation & Optimization:** SimPy, custom experiment design
- **API/Cloud:** Flask/FastAPI, Docker, GCP cloud implementations
