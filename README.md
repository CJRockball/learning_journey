## Executive Summary

This repository documents my systematic journey from domain expert in nanotechnology to full-stack, production-ready data scientist. Over five years, I completed 70+ hands-on projects, 50+ advanced certifications, and delivered modern machine learning solutions using the latest open-source libraries and cloud platforms.

- **Foundation Building:** Intensive upskilling in Python, statistics, ML, and cloud
- **Practical Application:** End-to-end projects from data wrangling to web deployment
- **Modern Workflows:** Productionization via Docker, FastAPI, LangChain, and more
- **Learning-in-Public:** Transparent record of raw code, refactoring, and skill development

All raw project code is documented *as is* to reflect genuine skill progression. Folders are organized to highlight learning phases and technology stacks, with honest badges indicating code maturity.

## Phases of Development

**Phase 1: Foundations (2020–2021)**
- Upgraded Python, statistics, and data visualization skills
- Completed foundations via Coursera specializations

**Phase 2: Applied ML (2021–2022)**
- Built and iterated on Kaggle, UCI, and public datasets
- First production ML deployments

**Phase 3: Deployment + Performance (2021–2024)**
- Moved projects to web, experimented with containerization
- GPU, big-data, and scalable ML implementations

**Phase 4: Modern AI (2024–2025)**
- Integrated LLMs, LangChain, generative AI
- Competed in advanced Kaggle and NeurIPS challenges

## Raw/Unpolished Code & Growth Mindset

Some code in early folders is left intentionally raw or only lightly refactored. This is *deliberate*: it documents practical learning cycles, iterative improvements, and technological catch-up after a career pivot.

See [TIMELINE.md](./TIMELINE.md) for project-by-project progress, with major milestones and evolving code quality tagged along the way.
