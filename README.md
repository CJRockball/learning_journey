# Patrick Carlberg – Data Science Learning Journey (2020–2025)

> **Transforming a career gap into deep technical expertise, project-based learning, and modern AI pipelines.**
<br>


## Executive Summary

This repository documents my systematic journey from domain expert in nanotechnology to full-stack, production-ready data scientist. Over five years, I completed 70+ hands-on projects, 50+ advanced certifications, and delivered modern machine learning solutions using the latest open-source libraries and cloud platforms.

- **Foundation Building:** Intensive upskilling in Python, statistics, ML, and cloud
- **Practical Application:** End-to-end projects from data wrangling to web deployment
- **Modern Workflows:** Productionization via Docker, FastAPI, LangChain, and more
- **Learning-in-Public:** Transparent record of raw code, refactoring, and skill development

All raw project code is documented *as is* to reflect genuine skill progression. Folders are organized to highlight learning phases and technology stacks, with honest badges indicating code maturity.

## Raw/Unpolished Code & Growth Mindset

Some code in early folders is left intentionally raw or only lightly refactored. This is *deliberate*: it documents practical learning cycles, iterative improvements, and technological catch-up after a career pivot.

See [TIMELINE.md](./TIMELINE.md) for project-by-project progress, with major milestones and evolving code quality tagged along the way.

## Value Proposition

- **Self-driven, systematic skill acquisition from first principles to production**
- **End-to-end project delivery, with honesty about unfinished/raw work**
- **Strong documentation practices, even for learning-phase code**
