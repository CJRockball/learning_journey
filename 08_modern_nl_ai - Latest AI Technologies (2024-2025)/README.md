# Modern AI - Phase 4 - (2024-2025)

## Phase Overview
Larger more integrated projects, applying AI agent technology. Thanks to agent support I can explore areas I'm less familiar with, such as prometheus and graphana for online tracking. Also I use AI to help with the HTML/CSS code, to make apps look better. It's an excellent tool to explore more advance topics. On a more fundamental level I explore transformers for tabular data in Pytorch. 

## Learning Objectives
- Primary focus Intergrated apps, web via FastAPI, agents with LangChain/LangGraph
- Secondary is deeper understanding of advanced ML
- Builds on all prior knowledge

## Key Projects

### [Serving XGB model](https://github.com/CJRockball/xgb_bu/tree/feature/deployment-stack) (22/07/2025-01/08/2025)
**Technologies:** XGB, FastAPI, Docker, Prometheus, Graphana
**Description:** Serving a machine learning solution online with advanced tracking features
**Learning Focus:** More complete set up for serving online
**Status:** Raw Code

### [RAG Chat](https://github.com/CJRockball/learning_journey/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) (15/07/2025-17/07/2025)
**Technologies:** FastAPI, LangChain/LangGraph, ChromaDB, PyPDF, HTML/CSS, Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx, Redis
**Description:** Basic RAG search with chat functionality
**Learning Focus:** Agent RAG with vector database, PDF parsing, Advanced web functions gunicorn, nginx, redis 
**Status:** Complete

## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python, HTML, CSS
- **Data Science:** XGB, Pytorch, LangChain/LangGraph
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Postgres via Docker

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** Extending previous learning on machine learning and web application
- **Challenges Overcome:** Identifieng gaps in knowledge, learning online. Learning Langchain/Langgraph.
- **Next Phase Setup:** Ideally the next step is fully integrated working systems
