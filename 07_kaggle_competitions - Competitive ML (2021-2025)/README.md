# Kaggle Competitions - P{hase 4 - (2024-2025)

## Phase Overview
I started doing Kaggle playground competitions in May 2024 to work with fresh datasets and to get a benchmark for the prediction. The goal was never to win a competition, the goal was to learn to develop the best individual models. Playground has many good datasets, however recently is seems a number of them are based on pure random data, which is not very interesting. So, I also explored some "real" competitions.

## Learning Objectives
- Primary objective was to improve data analysis skills 
- Improve specific aspects of machine learning such as transformers in neural networks for tabular data
- This builds on the previous work with "standard" datasets

## Key Projects

### [Project Name] ([Date Range])
**Technologies:** XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Pytorch
**Description:** Kaggle competition s5e5. Making individual models and ensembles
**Learning Focus:** Explored machine learning tools like XGB and Pytorch. Learned about feature engineering and ensembling
**Status:** Raw Code

## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Pure Python
- **Data Science:** XGBoost, Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, Polars, Matplolib, Seaborn, 
- **Infrastructure:** 

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** Improving all basic aspects of data science cleaning data, feature engineering, modelling data, analysing model
- **Challenges Overcome:** Larger dataset, about 1 miljon rows
- **Next Phase Setup:** The best way to understand is to solve a large number of problems. Done that. Next step is research
