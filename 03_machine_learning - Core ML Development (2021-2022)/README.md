# Applied ML - Phase 2 - (2021-2022)

## Phase Overview
Focus on different aspects of supervised learning. Trying different frameworks like gradient boosted trees and neural networks on classification and regression problems. Example of datasets include Tawain Credit card, ieee-fraud and MNIST

## Learning Objectives
- Primary focus was to clean, model and explain data
- Secondary to serve a model with FastAPI
- Established basic approach to working with data and modeling

## Key Projects

### [Taiwan Credit Card Dataset] ([28/11/2021 - 28/12/2021])
**Technologies:** XGboost, MLFlow, Shap
**Description:** Classification with ETL
**Learning Focus:** Learning to work through a datset, Separate functionality, 
**Status:** This is raw code, need refactoring

## Technologies Mastered
- **Programming:** Python, HTML, GPU
- **Data Science:** Tensorflow, XGBoost, LGB, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Shap, ELI5, 
- **Infrastructure:** FastAPI, Docker and deployment on Heroku

## Progression Notes
- **From Previous Phase:** I had prior experience with all methods, but applied them to larger datsets and work through the problems thoroughly on my own
- **Challenges Overcome:** Mentally working with larger datasets that you can't just plot 
- **Next Phase Setup:** Once you accept that you can't "see" the whole dataset, the only limitation you have is the RAM, and that can be overcome with dask.

## Code Status & Next Steps
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Some code in this phase is raw/unstructured from active learning period
üîÑ **Refactoring Plan:** [Planned improvements to code organization]
üìù **Documentation Status:** [Current state of project documentation]
